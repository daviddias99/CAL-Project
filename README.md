## Compilation/Installation

The project has its own make file and is ready to be open and compiled in CLion. 

Be aware that some Linux distributions won't be able to compile the project using the Makefile, as they won't recognise the **#ifdef linux** instruction. You can either manually clean these instructions or run it on an IDE like Clion, that will recognise them.

## Usage

CAL-Project has the following menu:

```
1- Choose city
2- Generate people
3- Add people to graph
4- Choose driver info
5- Show whole map
6- Show graph after driver DFS
7- Run Algorithm
8- Check complexity
0- Exit
```

* It is not possible to ask for 7 before 1,2,3 and 4. 
* It is not possible to ask for 5 before 1.
* It is not possible to ask for 8 before 1.
* It is not possible to ask for 6 before 4.
* No action is possible before 1
* If person-file for the city already exists, 2 may be skipped. If so, when choosing the driver, the user will be promptd to choose the destination node which must be the same as the destination of the existing person-file.
* If the user executes 2, when executing 4 the program will automatically use the randomly chosen destination of the people as the destination of the driver.
* To avoid unintended behaviour, 8 should not be run after 4,6 or 7, and 7 after 6. Any new runs of the algorithms should also be done by restarting the program.

## Dependencies
* [Graphviz - Graph Visualization Software](https://www.graphviz.org/)
